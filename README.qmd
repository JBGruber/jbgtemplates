# jbgtemplates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a collection of functions and templates I keep reusing.
I moved it here to keep my projects a little cleaner.

## Installation

You can install the development version of jbgtemplates like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/jbgtemplates")
```
